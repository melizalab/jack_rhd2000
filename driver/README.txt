RHD2000 USB Interface Software - Source Code
--------------------------------------------

This directory contains the RHD2000 Interface C++/Qt source code and two supporting files: main.bit
(the FPGA configuration file) and an operating system-specific Opal Kelly library file located in
the 'Opal Kelly library files' directory.

These two supporting files must reside in the directory with the executable file (i.e., the 'debug'
or 'release' folder generated when the code is compiled).  To find the executable directory on
a Mac, right-click on the RHD2000interface.app file generated by Qt, select "Show package contents",
and open the "MacOS" directory.

You should also download and install the USB drivers from the Intan Technologies website before
connecting the RHD2000 USB interface board to a computer.  (They are not included in this zip file.)
However, you can run the RHD2000 interface software in demonstration mode without installing drivers
or plugging in an interface board.

Some users have reported problems compiling under Linux or Mac unless they explicitly include every
Qt class that is used in a custom class.  Under Windows, the statement "#include <QtGui>" that is
already used in most of the .cpp files seems to be sufficient, but if the compiler complains, we have
included a file qtincludes.h in the source code directory that may be referenced from each .cpp file
by adding the line "#include "qtincludes.h".

Recommended C++/Qt Resources
----------------------------

The total source code is around 10,000 lines in length, and is written entirely in C++ using the
open-source Qt libraries for multi-platform GUI support. (The files composing the core Rhythm API
are written in straight C++ without using Qt.)

There are countless books and other online resources related to C++ programming, so these will not
be discussed here. For C++ programmers new to Qt, the best place to start is http://qt-project.org.
We recommend downloading the Qt SDK (Software Design Kit) including Qt Creator, Qt Assistant, and the
latest Qt libraries for the operating system of choice.

The best book we have found for first-time Qt programmers is C++ GUI Programming with Qt 4, Second
Edition, by Jasmin Blanchette and Mark Summerfield (ISBN 0-13-235416-0). Chapters 1-8 and 11-12, along
with Appendices A and B, cover nearly all the aspects of Qt used in the RHD2000 interface GUI. The
library documentation available in the Qt Assistant application is also excellent and indispensable.
