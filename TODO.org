* opal kelly driver installation

Linux and OS X don't need any additional USB drivers, although Linux needs a
rules file.  There's also a "libokFrontPanel" shared library. That source
appears to come from the API, but no instructions on how to compile (maybe in
pdf?)

* jack considerations

the jack module will be pulling data off the opal kelly fifo.  to keep latency
low this fifo should be kept as empty as possible. we can report latency to the
jack system with jack_port_set_latency_range. latency estimates will also
include any transmission delays, etc.  we may need to update from time to time
based on the fill state of the fifo
