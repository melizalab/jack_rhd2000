Project description

** Requirements

- POSIX-compliant operating system
- JACK audio connection kit, =0.121= (http://jackaudio.org)

** Installation

Put jack_rhd2000.so, libokFrontPanel.so, and rhythm_130302.bit in the same
directory. This can be the directory where the other JACK drivers live.

** Usage

: JACK_DRIVER_DIR=<driver dir> jackd -d rhd2000

Additional options can be appended to this command to configure the driver:

- =-d= :: specify the serial number of the Opal Kelly device to connect to. By
          default, the driver will connect to the first device.
- =-F= :: specify the path to the Intan RHD2000 eval board firmware. By
          default, the driver will look for a file called "rhythm_130302.bit" in the
          same directory as the driver
- =-r= :: specify the sampling rate, in Hz. Default is 30000 Hz. Only some
          values are supported by the hardware, so if the requested value is
          not available the driver will choose the nearest one
- =-p= :: specify the period size, in frames. This option sets the amount of
          time the driver will wait before pulling data off the driver. Larger
          values produce more stable behavior, but increase latency.
- =-I= :: configure the driver to leave additional samples in the eval board's
          FIFO. This increases latency, but may help to reduce buffer overruns.

RHD2000 chips on each of the four SPI ports can be configured with the =-A=,
=-B=, =-C=, and =-D= options. The arguments to these options are a
comma-delimited list of up to 5 values. If less than 5 values are supplied, the
defaults are used. The values are as follows:

1. A hexadecimal number controlling which amplifiers to power up. According to
   the Intan documentation, turning off amplifiers can reduce thermal noise.
   Default is 0xffffffff, which corresponds to 32 1's and turns on all
   amplifiers. 0xffff would only turn on the first 16.

2. A floating point number to set the highpass filter cutoff frequency, in Hz.
   Only some values are supported by the hardware, so the driver will choose
   the closest one if the requested value isn't available. Default is 100 Hz.

3. A floating point number to set the lowpass filter cutoff frequency, in Hz.
   Default is 3000 Hz.

4. A floating point number to set the highpass filter cutoff of the DSP
   integrated into the RHD2000 chip. Default is 1 Hz.

5. The SPI cable length, in meters, or 0 to auto-detect any connected chips.
   Default is to auto-detect.

On startup, the driver will attempt to connect to the Opal Kelly board, upload
the firmware, and detect/configure the connected amplifier chips. If no chip is
connected to an SPI port, or if '0' is used as the argument to a port's
configuration option, the port will be disabled. If these steps are successful,
the driver will create JACK ports for each enabled RHD2000 channel and for the
eight analog inputs on the eval board.

** Building from source

To build the driver from source, you need

- a modern c++ compiler
- the JACK source tree for the currently installed JACK version

The test programs require boost (http://http://www.boost.org; >= 1.42)

** Additional notes

The driver achieves low latency by reading data from the eval board's FIFO as
soon as a complete period is available. Due to the long and variable latency of
the USB bus, this may take a substantial proportion of the period. Using a linux
kernel patched for realtime preemption can greatly reduce the variance of the
time it takes to get data off the USB bus, but it's still rate-limited so that a
single RHD2000 amp takes 4.2 out of the available 33 ms in a 1024 frame period.
