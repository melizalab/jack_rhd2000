Project description

** Requirements

- POSIX-compliant operating system
- JACK audio connection kit, =0.121= (http://jackaudio.org)

** Installation

Put jack_rhd2000.so, libokFrontPanel.so, and rhythm_130302.bit in the same
directory. This can be the directory where the other JACK drivers live.

** Usage

: JACK_DRIVER_DIR=<driver dir> jackd -d rhd2000

Using RT kernel greatly reduces variance of the amount of time it takes to get
data off the USB bus, but it's still rate-limited so that a single RHD2000 amp
takes 4.2 out of the available 33 ms in a 1024 frame period.

** Building from source

To build the driver from source, you need

- a modern c++ compiler
- the JACK source tree for the currently installed JACK version

The test programs require boost (http://http://www.boost.org; >= 1.42)
